            I am a Software Engineer with experience across multiple roles and organizations, currently working as a
            Consultant at BengalQA in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering and
            Technology (BUET) with a B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering.
            of computer science.

            My primary research interests lie in Differential Privacy, Federated Learning, and Database Systems. I'm
            particularly passionate about Software Security and Large Language Models, with recent work focusing on
            Retrieval Augmented Generation. Through my undergraduate thesis on VLSI Layout Design, I gained valuable
            experience in hardware optimization and power consumption analysis.

            Through my professional experience, I have developed expertise in both frontend and backend development,
            working with various frameworks and technologies. At BengalQA, I've been deeply involved in designing and
            implementing chatbot solutions using OpenAI API and RAG techniques. My remote work experience with
            AODoubleClick (USA) has given me exposure to international software development practices, where I've
            implemented crucial features like STRIPE API integration and employee management systems. During my time at
            Computer Network Systems Limited, I contributed to significant government projects and developed a Business
            Intelligence engine for insurance forecasting.

            Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a strong track record in academic competitions, particularly in
            Physics and Math Olympiads. I've secured multiple top positions in various national and divisional rounds,
            demonstrating my analytical capabilities from an early age. I have consistently maintained academic
            excellence throughout my education, achieving perfect GPAs (5.0/5.0) in both my Secondary School
            Certificate and Higher Secondary Certificate examinations. My strong foundation in science and mathematics,
            combined with my practical experience in software development, positions me well
            for tackling complex technical challenges in the field

            Other than this I like to take photographs and play video games with my friends. I also like to watch movies
            and
            in my free time I like to travel with my wife to different places and experience new foods.
