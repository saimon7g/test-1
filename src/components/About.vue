            I am an undergraduate student in my final semester at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology
            (BUET), pursuing a B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I have
            developed a keen interest in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Software Security,
            with a particular focus on Differential Privacy, Federated Learning, and Database Systems.
        </p>
        <p class="text-primary dark:text-dark-text mb-4 lg:mb-6">
            My current research and projects explore cutting-edge technologies, with recent work centered on leveraging
            Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhancing Conversational AI. This
            aligns with my passion for exploring how AI can transform customer service and other domains through more
            accurate and efficient NLP systems.

        </p>
        <p class="text-primary dark:text-dark-text mb-4 lg:mb-6">
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained hands-on experience through various internships and
            projects. At BengalQA, where I currently work as a Consultant, I have contributed to building innovative
            chatbot solutions using OpenAI's API and RAG techniques. My previous experience working remotely with
            AODoubleClick (USA) has given me valuable exposure to international software development practices, where I
            contributed to features such as STRIPE API integration and employee management systems.

        </p>
        <p class="text-primary dark:text-dark-text mb-4 lg:mb-6">
            Aside from my academic and professional work, I have excelled in academic competitions, particularly in
            Physics and Math Olympiads, and have consistently maintained a high level of academic achievement throughout
            my studies. I am passionate about problem-solving and tackling complex challenges in software development
            and AI.

        </p>
        <p class="text-primary dark:text-dark-text mb-4 lg:mb-6">
            Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy photography, playing video games with friends,
            watching movies, and traveling with my wife to explore new places and experience different cultures.
            I am always eager to collaborate on open-source projects, research initiatives, and software development
            opportunities.
